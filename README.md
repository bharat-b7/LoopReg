# LoopReg
Repo for **"LoopReg: Self-supervised Learning of Implicit Surface Correspondences, Pose and Shape for 3D Human Mesh Registration, NeurIPS' 20 (Oral)"**

## Prerequisites
1. Cuda 10.0
2. Cudnn 7.6.5
3. Kaolin (https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin) - for SMPL registration
4. MPI mesh library (https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh)
5. Trimesh
6. Python 3.7.6
7. Tensorboard 1.15
8. Pytorch 1.4
9. SMPL pytorch from https://github.com/gulvarol/smplpytorch. I have included these files (with required modifications) in this repo.
10. Download SMPL from https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/

## Download pre-trained models
1. Download LoopReg weights: https://nextcloud.mpi-klsb.mpg.de/index.php/s/LkRPT3qpEWW8pQR
2. `mkdir <LoopReg directory>/experiments`
3. Put the downloaded weights in `<LoopReg directory>/experiments/`

## Test LoopReg
0. Spread SMPL from mesh surface to R^3.
`python spread_SMPL_function.py`
1. Make data split. Adjust paths in the scripts and run `make_data_split.py`.
2. Test LoopReg.
`python train_PartSpecificNet.py 1 -mode val -save_name corr -batch_size 16 -split_file assets/data_split_01_unsupervised.pkl`


For training/ testing on dataset, you'd need the following directory structure if you'd like to use our dataloaders:

[DATASETS]\
-[dataset]\
--[subject_01]\
---[scan.obj]\

## Train LoopReg
0. Spread SMPL from mesh surface to R^3.
`python spread_SMPL_function.py`
1. Make data split. Adjust paths in the script and run `make_data_split.py`. Make desired split for supervised and unsupervised training.
2. Warm start correspondence predictor with small amount of supervised data.
`python warup_PartSpecificNet.py -batch_size 16 -split_file assets/data_split_01_unsupervised.pkl`
3. Jointly optimise the correspondence network and SMPL parameters using self-supervised training.
`python train_PartSpecificNet.py 1 -batch_size 16 -cache_suffix cache_1 -split_file assets/data_split_01_supervised.pkl`
